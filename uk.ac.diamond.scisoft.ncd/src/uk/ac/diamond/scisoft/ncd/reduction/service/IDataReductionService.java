/**
 * This service is designed to run data reduction processing from
 * either the UI or from a headless java executable. The service
 * allows the algorithm in LazyNcdProcessing to be run in headless mode
 * by receiving an XML file file populates source providers. These
 * source providers are already available if the service is run in the 
 * UI because the NCD UI parts contribute them.
 * 
 * The service requires the following information:
 * 1. The XML file (this can be generated from source providers which are linked to the GUI).
 * 2. The mask and region, contributed via the persistence service.
 * 3. The raw nexus file contributed by file path.
 * 
 * This information is provided/configured by the IDataReductionContext
 * 
 * Usage:

 <code>
 
 IDataReductionService service = (IDataReductionService)Activator.getDefault().getService(IDataReductionService.class);
 IDataReductionContext context = service.createContext();
 context.setXXX(); // Send various properties to the context from the UI or the XML file.
 context.setMask(BooleanDataset mask);
 context.setRegion(ISectorROI region);
 
 service.configure(context); // Can throw exception if cannot configure service.
 
 // Loop over files - may be done in a job or thread.
 for(String rawFilePath : files) {
     service.execute(rawFilePath);
 }
 
 </code>
