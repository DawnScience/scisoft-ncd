         title="Specifying integration region">
      <description>
         We need to open image with scattering data from a calibration sample. Make sure that SAXS checkbox is selected in NCD Detector parameters view, appropriate detector is selected in the adjacent combo,
         2D option is selected and pixel size specified.

      <description>
         After selection sector area on the image radial profile will be plotted in &quot;Radial Profile&quot; view. We need to select peak positions on this plot to run calibration procedure.

         title="Selecting calibrant peaks for indexing (optional)">
      <description>
         Calibration procedure tries to index selected peaks automatically. In some cases when indexing procedure fails to assign correct indexes to the fitted peaks,
         it is possible to use only subset of calibrant peaks to steer fitting procedure towards correct index values.
