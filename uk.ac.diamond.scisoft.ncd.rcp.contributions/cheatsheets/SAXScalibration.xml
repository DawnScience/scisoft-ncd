      <description>
         Tools for calibration of SAXS detector are available in NCD Calibration perspective. Once calibration procedure is completed cailbration parameters will be applied to calculate scattering vector values in subsequent data reduction runs.

      <description>
         We need to open image with scattering data from a calibration sample. Make sure that SAXS checkbox is selected in NCD Detector parameters view, appropriate detector is selected in the adjacent combo,
         2D option is selected and pixel size specified.

      <description>
		Some detectors have inactive areas or damaged pixels. Masking tool allows us to mark these regions to ignore them in sector integration calculations.
