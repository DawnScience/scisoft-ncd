         We need to open image with scattering data from a calibration sample. Make sure that SAXS checkbox is selected in NCD Detector parameters view, appropriate detector is selected in the adjacent combo,
         2D option is selected and pixel size specified.

         label="IMPORTANT! Do not use &quot;NCD Calibration&quot; perspective for browsing data as it is designed specifically for running calibration process and does not include essential components for data browsing (i.e. &quot;Dataset Inspector&quot; view). For data browsing, please use &quot;NCD Data Reduction&quot; or &quot;DExplore&quot; perspectives instead.">
