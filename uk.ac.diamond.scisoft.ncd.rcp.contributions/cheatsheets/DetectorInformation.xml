      <description>
         Select single file or multiple NeXus files with your experimental data by holding SHIFT or CTRL keys in the project explorer view. Detectors present only in all the selected files will be loaded into the relevant fields in NCD Detector Parameters view.<br/>
         IMPORTANT! For most cases selecting single experimental data file should be enough for setting up detector information. Including files that don't have appropriate structure (e.g. .h5 or processing results files) could prevent correct setting of detector information.
